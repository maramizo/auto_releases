# auto_releases
Automatically release your changes based on your commit content once your PR is closed.
To use, create a commit that contains "release:<your_release_tag>".

Once your PR is approved, this workflow will automatically create a new release for you, edit the labels on the original PR and update it to include the link of the release.
